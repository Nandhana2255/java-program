it was a fine morning or we can say early noon.the sunrays makes its way through the windows.the clock strikes 9.the sound of birds chirping,the squiralls running here and there,puppies wining and playing with eachother and oscillation of trees due to breeze making the morning blissful.a boy of age betwen 15 and 16 is sleeping on the bed..suddenly his phone rings..his sleep is disturbed and he picks up the call.."hello..."he said in sleepy tone.the person on the other end said something and suddenly he woke up from the bed and said,"oh shit!,main ye kaise bhool gaya?..ok i'll be there in 10 mins"..he kept his phone aside and rushed to the bathroom to take bath..he came out with a towel wrapped around his hip..his wet hairs dripping water droplets..his dark brown orbs,his fair skin and his well maintained arms makes his appearance dashing..he is none other than ANIRUDH..he took a white shirt and wore it..he took his phone and ran out of his room.."deepa,where is my car key?",he shouted in hurry as he was coming down from the stairs..deepa(house maid)came running,holding the  car key in one hand and breakfast in other .ani took the car key from her hand was about to go out that's when deepa told him to have the breakfast before leaving..ani-"i don't want anything..i have to go now".he drove his car very fast and finally reached the restaurant..(today anirudh's best friend    birthday..so he's throwing a party to his friends in a restaurant)
